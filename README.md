# ✨ Custom Affirmation Generator

A beautiful, modern web application that helps users create personalized affirmations based on their desires, fears, and aspirations.

## 🌟 Features

- **Personalized Affirmations**: Generate custom affirmations based on 5 key inputs
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive design with gradient backgrounds and smooth animations
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Easy sharing of generated affirmations
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on all devices
- **Accessibility**: Focus states and keyboard navigation support

## 📝 How It Works

Users provide 5 key pieces of information:

1. **What do you want at the moment in your life?** - Their current desires and goals
2. **What is your fear?** - Any fears or obstacles they're facing
3. **Is there anyone's blessing you want to have?** - Religious figures, fictional characters, or spiritual guides
4. **What is your ideal outcome?** - Their perfect scenario or desired result
5. **How should we address you?** - Personal way to address them in the affirmation

The app then generates a personalized, uplifting affirmation that incorporates all these elements.
